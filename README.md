# Calculator Web Application

Welcome to the **Calculator Web Application**! ðŸš€

This is not just any ordinary calculator. It's built with the power of **data structures** to handle mathematical operations in an efficient and structured way. Unlike basic calculators that directly evaluate expressions, this app takes a deep dive into data structures such as **expression trees** and **stacks** to process and compute expressions.

### Features:

- **Expression Tree**: The app constructs an expression tree, where every operator is linked with its operands in a tree-like structure.
- **Prefix Conversion**: It converts the expression tree into a **prefix** notation, which is essential for processing the operations correctly.
- **Stack-Based Evaluation**: The calculations are performed by evaluating the expression using a **stack**, ensuring an efficient evaluation process.
- **Simple and Clean UI**: A user-friendly interface with easy-to-use buttons and inputs.

### How It Works:

1. **Expression Parsing**: When you input an arithmetic expression, itâ€™s parsed into an expression tree.
2. **Prefix Conversion**: The expression tree is transformed into prefix notation.
3. **Stack Evaluation**: The prefix expression is evaluated using a stack-based approach, ensuring correct order of operations.
4. **Result**: The result is displayed to you in a split second!

### Technologies Used:

- **JavaScript**: For the application logic and event handling.
- **HTML/CSS**: For a simple, clean UI.
- **Data Structures**: Expression Tree, Prefix Conversion, and Stack.

### Demo:

### Installation:

To run this app locally:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TaifoorFarid/Calculator
   ```

2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.

### Usage:

- Enter an arithmetic expression in the input field.
- Hit the "=" button to get the result.
- Use the "Clear" button to reset the input.
